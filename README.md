# Patient Regression Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental data science techniques using a dataset of patient measurements. The data, captured using the Machine Medicine Technologies product KELVIN, includes various body measurements:

- **Height**: The height of the patient.
- **Face**: The length of the patient’s face.
- **Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4**: Additional variables whose specifics are not provided but are included in the dataset.

## Key Techniques and Analyses

### 1. Data Pre-Processing

Effective pre-processing is crucial for accurate data analysis. Key steps include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and managing any missing or null values to maintain data quality.
2. **Data Normalization**: Standardizing or normalizing measurements to ensure consistency, especially important for modeling.
3. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and addressing outliers to prevent skewed results, particularly in critical measurements like height.

### 2. Unit of Measurement for Patient Height

Determine the unit of measurement for patient height by:

- Comparing the height values to standard ranges (e.g., meters or centimeters).
- Analyzing the data for any anomalies that might suggest unconventional units.

### 3. Distribution Plot Function

Visualize the distribution of a specified column to understand the spread and frequency of values within that column. This helps in analyzing the data's characteristics and trends.

### 4. Visual Summary of the Dataset

Summarize the dataset visually using:

- **Pair Plots**: To show relationships between different variables.

### 5. Average Patient Height

Estimate the average height of patients in the dataset and determine if it is significantly greater than 750 units. This provides insight into typical height ranges within the dataset.

### 6. Distribution of Torso Length

Characterize the distribution of torso length by summarizing key statistics such as the mean, median, and standard deviation. This helps in understanding the variability and central tendency of torso lengths.

### 7. Comparison of Arm Lengths

Use statistical tests to compare the length of the left arm and right arm, identifying if there is a significant difference between these two measurements.

### 8. Comparison of Shin Lengths

Compare the `left_shin` and `left_shin2` columns to assess consistency or discrepancies between these two measurements.

### 9. Linear Regression Modeling

#### Simple Model

Train a linear regression model to predict height using other variables in the dataset. Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as R-squared and mean squared error to understand how well the model fits the data.

#### Complex Model

Compare the performance of a more sophisticated regression model (e.g., Regularized Linear Regression) to the simple model to evaluate improvements and understand the impact of different modeling approaches.

## Conclusion

The **`patient_regression_analysis`** project illustrates fundamental data science techniques, including data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and linear regression modeling. The aim is to showcase these core concepts and their application to real-world data.
